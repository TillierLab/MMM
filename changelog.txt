outdated: all subsequent changes are intended to be stored in the git log


todo:
	put command-line options in a struct for easier management
	parse options in a separate function
	after testing remove the artificial limit on distances
	add -nocache option [didn't work, because cache mechanics is embedded
	in the very core of the methods]
2013-04-11
	Added gzip input and output
	Force opening of output file in all cases, because it was interferring
	with gzip options (and it's never a good idea to skip making a file
	when one is expected).
	Removed range start/end options, also because of gzip (and it was
	never being used anyway, especially not with new MMM version, should
	try OpenMP+MPI if really need parallel processing)
	Fixed the bug where coninued as normal when output file could not be
	created.
	Problems: completes without an error if the input format is invalid (i.e. txt instead of gzip)

2013-02-25
	Switched to git version control system
2013-02-08
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Made -z option (do not skip zero scores) valid for MMMLmode. The format is not pretty,
		but the only requirement was to output the clade sets IDs for
		the input matrices, which it does.
2013-01-15
	ProteinGroup.hpp
		Added throw_error function to allow for inclusion of filename
		into the error reports

2012-12-03
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		disabled abnormal exit if slice of pmbq cannot be created -
		often the filename can exceed the filesystem limit, but that's
		not a sufficient reason to terminate the run altogether
2012-11-23
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		corrected syntax for printslices and printpmbq options.
2012-11-05
	Alignment.cpp
		Be more flexible with alignment format:
			convert lower-case to upper-case
			if not a valid amino acid or a gap then treat as X (unknown = gap)
			Note: these changes will are permanent, i.e. will be appied if the aligment is printed at any point. 
2012-10-25
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Added command-line options to 
		a) filter out sequences with high gap proportion
		b) print generated slices and matrices (mainly for debugging)
2012-10-22
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Added the -aln2pmb command line option to enable recent additions.
		Wrote usage info for -aln2pmb  
2012-10-19
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
	Alignment.cpp
		For slices implemented multiple comma-separated ranges as well as inverse ranges.
2012-10-18
	Created ProteinGroup parent class for Alignment and DistanceMatrix classes.
		Tried to make find_in_cache as inherited, but vector<child> cannot be casted as vector<parent>
2012-10-11
	DistanceMatrix.cpp, Alignment.cpp:
		Rewrote abnormal exits as exceptions, so that the program can continue a batch if one file was bad.
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Added caching of alignments (10)
		Parses names in batch file as:	alignment_filename|region_name:region_start-region_end
2012-10-08
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp
		Added a caching scheme for distance matrices (longest unused goes out first).
		Implemented the conversion of .aln files to .pmb (quck method)
	DistanceMatrix.cpp:
		Reduced precision when returning distances as 1D vector (to mimic the distances obtained from protdist output)
2012-05-05
	Rewrote the Makefile
2012-05-17 (reqTax is still not completely fixed)
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp: fixed matrix rearrangement strategy. 
2012-05-10 Per Robert's suggestion:
	mmm_algorithm.cpp:
		Moved the check for required taxon to the outermost loop (so that only the first matrix is ever considered)
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Removed the required taxon rearrangement for the second matrix (became unnecessary after the above)
2012-04-05
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Since a downstream optimization in mmm_algorithm.cpp would skip over the taxons thought to be covered by the initial iteration,
		the taxons need to be rearranged to put the requied taxon at the top of the list. Done via the "rearrangeMatrix" function.
		Separated "processTaxonLabels" functions into 2 calls to a simpler version.
2012-03-29
	mmm_algorithm.cpp:
		Made a fix for the -req option, by adding a check for the required taxon in the outer loop via the "satisfiesReqTax" function. Not tested much yet.
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Added a check for -req option to be only permitted in conjunction with -u
2012-03-28
	MatrixMatchMaker.cpp:
		Added a warning that -req option is broken. As of 2010-11-05, Alex was planning to put it back in, but it seems like he never got to it.
2012-01-10
	mmm_algorithm.h:
		Increased sizes for static vectors and added warning messages when they are exceeded.
2012-01-12
	mmm_algorithm.h:
		Added automatic size doubling for the vectors in question.
		Fixed? the bug where the -maxtrees parameter would get ignored.
2012-01-15
	Makefile:
		Changed the format. Added mmmWithL_debug executable (the one compiled with -D DEBUG directive)
	mmm_algorithm.h:
		Added DEBUG preprocessing directive to control the output of the notifications accompaning the vector resizing from the previous fix.
